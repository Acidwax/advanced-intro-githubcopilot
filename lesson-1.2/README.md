## üìëKey Terms
- Repository - A repository contains all your project's files and each file's revision history.
- Branch - A branch is a parallel version of your repository. By default, your repository has one branch named main and it is the definitive branch.  Creating additional branches allows you and others to safely make any changes without disrupting the main project.
- Profile ReadMe - is essentially an "About me" section on your GitHub profile where you can share information about yourself with the community on GitHub.com.
- Commit -  A commit is a set of changes to the files and folders in your project.
- Pull Request - Collaboration happens on a pull request. The pull request shows the changes in your branch to other people and allows people to accept, reject, or suggest additional changes to your branch. Once accepted, changes are merged to main branch.
